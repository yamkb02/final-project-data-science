# MovieLens 20M Dataset Analysis & Movie Recommendations

This project provides an interactive analysis of the MovieLens 20M dataset, focusing on exploring and visualizing data, handling missing values, applying association rule mining, and generating movie recommendations based on genre associations. The app uses **Streamlit**, **Pandas**, **Plotly**, and **MLxtend** to deliver a user-friendly interface and dynamic visualizations.

## Overview

The **MovieLens 20M dataset** is a rich source of movie ratings, genres, and tags that enables comprehensive analysis and recommendation systems. The project allows users to:

- Explore datasets (Movies, Ratings, and Tags)
- Preprocess the data (handling missing values, converting timestamps, etc.)
- Visualize key insights from exploratory data analysis
- Apply **Association Rule Mining** using the **Apriori algorithm** to uncover hidden patterns in movie genres
- Generate movie recommendations based on genre associations

The project provides interactive features, allowing users to adjust parameters (like support and confidence) and visualize the results in real-time.

## Features

### 1. **Data Overview**  
- Overview of the **Movies**, **Ratings**, and **Tags** datasets
- Option to sample a subset of the data for exploration
- Displays basic dataset statistics (number of movies, ratings, tags, etc.)

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**  
- Handling missing values in each dataset
- Converting Unix timestamps into human-readable dates
- Extracting genres for one-hot encoding and further analysis

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Visualize the **Top 10 Most Rated Movies**
- Explore the **Distribution of Ratings**
- Analyze **Ratings Over Time**
- Examine the **Genre Distribution** of movies

### 4. **Association Rule Mining with Apriori**  
- Generate **frequent itemsets** based on genre combinations
- Apply **Apriori algorithm** to uncover **association rules**
- Visualize the relationships between genres using support, confidence, and lift

### 5. **Movie Recommendations**  
- Generate **movie recommendations based on genre associations**
- Explore how movie genres relate to one another using association rules

### 6. **Interactive Visualizations**  
- Use **Plotly** for creating dynamic bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots
- Interactive tables to explore association rules
- Visual storytelling with **lottie animations** for enhancing user experience

## Technologies

- **Streamlit**: Framework for building interactive data apps
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Plotly**: Interactive visualizations
- **MLxtend**: Machine learning extensions, used here for **association rule mining**
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations
- **Python**: Programming language

## Running the Application

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movielens-recommendation.git
   cd movielens-recommendation
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   You can use `pip` to install the necessary packages. First, create a virtual environment and activate it, then install the required libraries:
   
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Alternatively, you can install the individual dependencies manually:
   
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas plotly mlxtend numpy
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   This will start a local development server and open the app in your web browser. You can interact with the application directly.
